# attention-velocity

MVP to rank Solana trending pools by on-chain velocity and social velocity (X).  
Current status: on-chain scoring via GeckoTerminal; social velocity integration in progress.

## On-chain scoring
Pulls Solana trending pools and ranks by:
- 1h volume
- 1h transactions
- acceleration (m5/m15 vs h1)
- price change

## Roadmap
- X search velocity (counts per minute)
- Combined score (on-chain + social)
- Export + alerts

## Usage
TBD (scripts to be added).
